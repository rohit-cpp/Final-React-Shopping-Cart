## 📚 What I Learned

While building this project, I encountered several real-world issues that helped me learn so much more than just writing code. Here are a few major takeaways:

### 🔁 React Hooks
- `useState`  
- `useEffect`  
- `useNavigate`  
- `useParams`  

### 🧠 JavaScript Skills
- Array methods like `map()` and `reduce()` helped me manage product listings and total cart price  
- `localStorage` for saving and retrieving cart data across sessions

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

This project wasn’t smooth sailing, but every error became an opportunity to learn:

1. ❌ **Git Errors:**
   - I lost the project *twice* due to Git push/pull mistakes 😓  
   - I had to recover the files and reinitialize parts of the code, which taught me a lot about version control and backups  

2. 💸 **Price Calculation Bug:**
   - While implementing the cart, I ran into issues with the total price functionality  
   - Thanks to a super helpful video by **Sangam Mukherjee**, I was able to identify and fix the problem. Huge shoutout to him! 🙌

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🛠️ Debugging and problem-solving are essential developer skills  
- 🔥 Consistency and a never-give-up attitude are more important than writing perfect code  
- 📉 You’ll make mistakes (a lot of them), but each one teaches you something valuable
